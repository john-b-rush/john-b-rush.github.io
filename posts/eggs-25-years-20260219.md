# Codex, Claude and 25 Years of Eggs

*Published: February 19, 2026*

I have a problem. Since 2001, I've kept every grocery receipt that included eggs. It started as a college budget spreadsheet in Moscow, Idaho and turned into a compulsion — a shoebox, then a folder, then a phone photo habit that followed me to Portland and then Seattle.

Earlier this month I finally did something with them. I scanned the paper ones, ran OCR on the photos, and let Claude and Codex argue about how to structure the data. The result is roughly 570 purchase records spanning 25 years, three cities, and a lot of eggs.

This post is what that data looks like.

## The Price of Eggs

Egg prices are one of those things everyone has an opinion about but nobody tracks. I tracked them — not on purpose, but by accident of hoarding.

The broad arc: eggs cost about a dollar a dozen when I was in college. They crept up slowly through the 2000s and 2010s. Then in late 2022, avian flu hit the supply chain and prices doubled almost overnight. They've come down since, but not to where they were.

The "Inflation-Adjusted" toggle is the interesting one. Adjusted for CPI, eggs were actually getting *cheaper* from 2001 to about 2020. The 2022–2023 spike broke that trend hard.

## Where I Bought Them

I lived in Moscow, Idaho from 2001 to about 2014 — a college town where WinCo and Safeway were the only real options. Trips to Portland started around 2010, first for visits, then more permanently. By 2018 I was splitting time between Portland and Seattle, and by 2020 Seattle became home base.

Hit play to watch the migration. The map zooms out as new cities appear.

## The Running Total

This is just the raw number. Every carton, every half-dozen impulse buy, every 24-pack from Costco that one time. Twenty-five years of breakfast.

## Every Purchase, Every Week

A different view of the same data: one cell per week, 25 years of rows. Darker green means more purchases that week. You can see the rhythm — mostly biweekly, with gaps for travel and the occasional stretch where I just forgot to buy eggs.

## How This Was Made

The receipts were real but the digitization pipeline was the fun part. I used a mix of Apple's document scanner, Tesseract OCR, and Claude to extract structured data from photos of faded thermal paper. Codex helped write the data cleaning scripts. The visualizations are vanilla JavaScript — no D3, no React, just Canvas and SVG.
